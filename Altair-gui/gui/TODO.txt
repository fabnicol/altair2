TODO:
fix cdrecord regression: revert to older states !   
Refeed console.
fix selecting of many tracks when moving up/down
fix ordering of subordinate tags in project manager
fix resample bug when not clicking in directory  view
fix extra comma at end of --screentex <-> control screentext length depending on audio track count per group
fix application of "all slide transitions" to all slides: crashes when slides tabs already set.
test --dvdv-slides : appears to overgenerate on first tab (?)
fix issue of --dvdv-slides=... being generated with older slides whilst a new radio button is now set.
  When the slides frame widget is no longer enabled, --dvdv-slides should not be generated.
  [General FWidgets issue: impede both command line and XML generation when disabled]
add a try catch at dvp loading stage: when dvp has problematic settings, 
  application will crash on launch unless default.dvp is erased manually, should it be specified with default .dvp 
  loading on launch. This can be avoided by trCatch on dvdp and a fallback on an empty dvp; or ideally with just the xml 
  that can be read without any issue.
